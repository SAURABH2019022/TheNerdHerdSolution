The visibility sensor enhances safety in low-visibility conditions like fog by using radar, LiDAR, ultrasonic, infrared, and camera technologies to detect nearby obstacles and provide real-time information to the driver. Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sources for accurate object detection. The cost-effectiveness is achieved.
